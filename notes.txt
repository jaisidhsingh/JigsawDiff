NOTES:
------

1. condition the denoising of the target image (unshuffled)
   on the source image (shuffled) in latent space of an AE.

2. use pretrained SD VQVAE and condition via concatenating
   the latent codes of the source and target images.

3. use a 1x1 convolution to make it usable as input to SD
   pretrained UNet, and then fine-tune.

4. key insights/choices seem to be the usage of discrete 
   latent representations of the shuffled and unshuffled
   images which can better aid this task than DDPMs.
